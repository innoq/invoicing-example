# Example Project for Software Architecture Summit

Example project for [our talk at Software Architecture
Summit](https://software-architecture-summit.de/softwarearchitektur/moderne-frontend-entwicklung/).
The main objective is to show component-based development. We will also show
some of our favorite tools:

* complate
* faucet
* aiur
* eslint
* stylelint
* prettier
* tabelle
* Custom Elements

## Setup (without Docker)

[Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

In this directory run:

```
npm i
```

Now you need to run:

```
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to visit the app, and http://localhost:4001 to visit the pattern library.
